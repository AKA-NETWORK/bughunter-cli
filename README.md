# `bughunter-cli` üêû

**A powerful, all-in-one command-line interface designed for modern bug hunting, security analysis, and streamlined development workflows.**

`bughunter-cli` combines essential security scanning tools with AI-powered analysis and robust GitHub integration, making it the perfect companion for security researchers, penetration testers, and developers who prioritize a secure development lifecycle.

## VibeOps Engineering

`bughunter-cli` is designed with the principles of **VibeOps** in mind. VibeOps is an emerging engineering culture that uses AI and natural language to automate and simplify the entire software development lifecycle. This tool embodies the VibeOps philosophy by:

- **Enhancing Developer Experience (DevEx):** Providing a seamless, conversational interface to complex security and development tasks.
- **AI-Assisted Workflow:** Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, and payload generation.
- **CI/CD and Automation:** Automating routine tasks like project cleanup, package publishing, and eventually, CI/CD pipeline integration.
- **AI SRE:** Using AI to move towards a future of AI-driven Site Reliability Engineering, where monitoring and remediation are increasingly automated.

## Overview

This tool is built to be your go-to utility for a variety of tasks, from initial reconnaissance to reporting and development automation. It replaces the need for multiple disparate scripts and tools by providing a single, consistent interface for:

*   **Reconnaissance:** Discover subdomains and scan for open ports.
*   **Code Scanning:** Scan code for vulnerabilities using Semgrep.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities against the GitHub Advisory Database.
*   **AI-Powered Security Analysis:** Leverage Google's Gemini Pro to analyze targets, identify potential vulnerabilities, and generate custom attack payloads.
*   **Development Workflow:** Seamlessly interact with GitHub to manage issues, pull requests, and comments directly from your terminal.
*   **Project Maintenance:** Automate cleanup tasks, manage releases, and publish Python packages with ease.

## Key Features

*   **Subdomain Enumeration:** Quickly find subdomains for a target domain using `crt.sh`.
*   **Port Scanning:** Integrated `nmap` for scanning top open ports.
*   **Code Scanning:** Language-agnostic code scanning with Semgrep.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Uses `osv-scanner` to find vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
*   **AI-Driven Vulnerability Analysis:** Get an AI-generated security report on a target and its subdomains.
*   **AI Payload Generation:** Create tailored payloads (XSS, SQLi, etc.) for specific technology stacks.
*   **Full GitHub Integration:**
    *   Initialize and authenticate with your GitHub account.
    *   Create and manage Pull Requests.
    *   Pull and view repository Issues.
    *   Push comments to Issues and PRs.
*   **Package Publishing:** Built-in commands to build and publish your Python package to PyPI or a private repository.
*   **Project Cleanup:** A simple `autoclean` command to remove temporary files, build artifacts, and virtual environments.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bughunter-cli.git
    cd bughunter-cli
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install the CLI in editable mode:**
    This makes the `bughunter` command available in your terminal.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

5.  **Install External Scanners:**
    `bughunter-cli` relies on powerful external tools for some of its scanning capabilities.

    *   **Install `osv-scanner` (for dependency scanning):**
        Follow the official installation instructions at [google.github.io/osv-scanner/](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/).

    *   **Install `nmap` (for port scanning):**
        `nmap` is a system dependency. Install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install nmap` on Debian/Ubuntu).

## Configuration

`bughunter-cli` requires a few API keys to unlock its full potential.

### 1. Gemini API Key (for AI features)

The AI analysis and payload generation features are powered by Google Gemini.

1.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory.
3.  Add your API key to the `.env` file:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```

### 2. GitHub Personal Access Token (for GitHub integration)

To interact with GitHub, you need to provide a Personal Access Token (PAT).

1.  Generate a PAT from your GitHub account settings. Ensure it has the necessary scopes (`repo`, `read:org`).
2.  Run the `github init` command and paste your token when prompted. The token will be stored securely in a local configuration file (`~/.bughunter_config`).
    ```bash
    bughunter github init
    ```
