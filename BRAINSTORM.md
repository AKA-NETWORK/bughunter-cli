# Brainstorming: AI-Powered Bug Hunter CLI

This document outlines ideas for the `bughunter-cli`, a tool that uses AI to find and help resolve bugs in code.

## Core Functionality

- **Static Analysis:**
  - Use an AI model to read and understand code without executing it.
  - Identify potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells based on patterns learned from vast datasets of code.
  - Examples: Null pointer exceptions, resource leaks, race conditions, insecure API usage.

- **Dynamic Analysis:**
  - Instrument and run the code (or unit tests) in a sandboxed environment.
  - Monitor execution for unexpected behavior, crashes, or memory errors.
  - AI can guide the input generation (fuzzing) to explore code paths more intelligently.

- **Vulnerability Detection:**
  - Fine-tune models specifically for security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows).
  - Analyze dependencies for known CVEs and assess their impact on the current project.

- **Automated Patching:**
  - Suggest code fixes for identified bugs.
  - Generate patches that the user can review and apply.
  - The AI should explain *why* the patch works.

- **Test Case Generation:**
  - Automatically generate unit tests that reproduce a discovered bug.
  - Create new test cases to improve code coverage for critical areas.

## CLI Commands

- `bughunter scan <path>`: Scan a file or directory for bugs.
  - `--type <static|dynamic|all>`: Specify the analysis type.
  - `--profile <quick|deep>`: Choose a scan profile.
  - `--output <json|html|stdout>`: Define the output format for the report.

- `bughunter report <scan-id>`: Display a detailed report of a previous scan.
  - `--bug <bug-id>`: Show details for a specific bug.

- `bughunter patch <scan-id> <bug-id>`: Attempt to automatically generate a patch for a bug.
  - `--apply`: Automatically apply the patch if confidence is high.

- `bughunter test <scan-id> <bug-id>`: Generate a failing test case for the identified bug.

- `bughunter configure`: Configure the CLI tool.
  - Set up API keys for AI models.
  - Define project-specific rules and ignore lists.
  - `bughunter configure --model <openai|gemini|local>`

## AI Integration

- **Local vs. Cloud Models:**
  - Allow users to use a local, privacy-focused model (e.g., running via Ollama).
  - Support powerful cloud-based models via APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic).

- **Fine-Tuning:**
  - The tool could learn from the user's codebase and feedback.
  - If a user consistently marks a certain type of finding as a false positive, the AI should learn to ignore it in the future.

- **Explainability:**
  - For every bug found, the AI must provide a clear explanation of:
    1. What the bug is.
    2. Why it's a problem.
    3. How the suggested fix resolves it.
    4. The potential impact if not fixed.

## User Experience (UX)

- **Interactive Mode:** An interactive `bughunter shell` that guides the user through the process of scanning, reviewing, and patching.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Provide a GitHub Action or GitLab CI component to run `bughunter` automatically in pipelines.
- **Rich Reports:** Generate HTML reports with syntax highlighting, code snippets, and clear visualizations of the issues.

- `bughunter pull-push`: A command to synchronize findings between the local environment and a remote server or git repository.
  - `pull`: Download the latest bug reports and analysis results from the server.
  - `push`: Upload local findings and manual corrections to the server.
  - `--remote <url>`: Specify the remote server URL.
  - `--repo`: Use the git repository as the remote storage.
