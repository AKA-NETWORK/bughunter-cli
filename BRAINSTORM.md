# Brainstorming: AI-Powered Bug Hunter CLI

This document outlines ideas for the `bughunter-cli`, a tool that uses AI to find and help resolve bugs in code. Our core focus is on providing best-in-class support for **Web Engineering** and **Embedded Systems**.

## Core Functionality

- **Static Analysis:** Use AI models and specialized tools like Semgrep and `cppcheck` to find bugs without executing code.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Instrument and run code in a sandboxed environment to find runtime errors.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Fine-tune models for specific vulnerability classes in web and embedded contexts.
- **Automated Patching:** Suggest and apply AI-generated code fixes with user confirmation.
- **Test Case Generation:** Automatically create unit tests to reproduce bugs and improve coverage.

## Web Engineering Focus

- **Targeted Web Vulnerability Scanning:**
  - `bughunter scan web --url <url>`: A dedicated command to run a suite of web-focused scans.
  - Integrate Semgrep rulesets for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc.).
  - Scan for vulnerabilities in popular frameworks like React, Angular, Django, and Ruby on Rails.

- **API Security Scanning:**
  - `bughunter scan api --spec <openapi.json>`: Analyze OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for security flaws (e.g., improper authentication, excessive data exposure).
  - `bughunter fuzz api --url <api-endpoint>`: Use AI-driven fuzzing to test live API endpoints for unexpected behavior.

- **Web Server Configuration Analysis:**
  - `bughunter scan config --server <nginx|apache>`: Scan `nginx.conf`, `.htaccess`, and other web server configuration files for common security misconfigurations.

- **Frontend Security:**
  - Analyze JavaScript dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - Scan for insecure use of `postMessage`, JWT handling flaws, and other client-side vulnerabilities.

## Embedded Systems Focus

- **Advanced C/C++ Analysis:**
  - `bughunter scan c-cpp <path>`: Utilize `cppcheck` and other tools to find memory leaks, buffer overflows, race conditions, and undefined behavior.
  - Integrate with memory sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer) for dynamic analysis.

- **Firmware Analysis:**
  - `bughunter scan firmware <firmware.bin>`: A command to unpack firmware images and analyze their contents.
  - Automatically identify the underlying OS and filesystem.
  - Scan for hardcoded secrets, private keys, and insecure default configurations.
  - Use emulation (e.g., QEMU) to perform dynamic analysis of the firmware in a sandboxed environment.

- **Hardware-Specific Security:**
  - **(Future)** `bughunter scan hdl <path>`: Integrate with tools to analyze hardware description languages (Verilog, VHDL) for security flaws.
  - **(Future)** Check for common hardware vulnerabilities like JTAG and UART debug access.

- **RTOS-Specific Checks:**
  - Analyze code for common vulnerabilities in real-time operating systems (RTOS) like FreeRTOS and Zephyr.

## General Future Ideas

- **AI-Driven Refactoring:** Suggest improvements to code structure, readability, and performance.
- **Interactive Learning:** Create a `bughunter learn` command to teach users about the vulnerabilities found in their code.
- **Configuration-as-Code:** Allow all settings to be defined in a `bughunter.yml` file for version-controlled, repeatable scans.

## AI Integration

- **Local vs. Cloud Models:** Support both local, privacy-focused models and powerful cloud-based models.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Allow the tool to learn from user feedback to reduce false positives.
- **Explainability:** Provide clear explanations for every bug found, including why it's a problem and how the fix resolves it.
